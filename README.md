# Credit Risk Analysis - JPMorgan Chase Simulation

## Project Summary:
Built a logistic regression model to predict personal loan default probabilities using borrower data. The model estimates PD and expected losses (10% recovery), helping the bank manage risk and allocate capital efficiently.

## Implementation: 
- Cleaned and prepared borrower data for modeling.

- Trained a logistic regression model to predict the probability of default (PD).

- Evaluated model performance using accuracy metrics to ensure reliable predictions.

- Used predict_proba to estimate expected loan losses (10% recovery rate).

- Engineered features, including FICO score buckets using KBinsDiscretizer with KMeans binning.
